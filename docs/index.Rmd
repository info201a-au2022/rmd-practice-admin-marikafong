## Covid Report
Covid-19 has affected the US in multiple different sectors over the past 2 years. I will highlight that the total number of US cases is `r get_total_cases()`. And, the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. 

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)
Yes you can with scale_y_continuous(labels = scales :: comma)

I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
